# 🎮 Catch the Ball – Python Turtle Game

## 📋 Project Overview

**Catch the Ball** is a simple arcade-style game developed using **Python Turtle Graphics**, where the player controls a paddle to catch a continuously bouncing ball. The goal is to prevent the ball from touching the red-bordered ground while increasing your score with each successful catch.

This project was developed as part of the **Computer Science** curriculum for **Class XI** .

## 🎯 Objectives

- Apply Python programming concepts to develop a functional game.
- Utilize event handling and animation using Turtle module.
- Enhance logical thinking and problem-solving through game mechanics.
- Explore sound integration and modular coding in Python.
- Understand and implement the **System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies and Modules Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Turtle** – for drawing graphics.
- **OS** – for system-level operations.
- **Winsound** – for playing sound effects (Windows only).

## 📈 Gameplay Rules

- Control the paddle using **left** and **right arrow keys**.
- Catch the yellow ball with the paddle before it hits the red border.
- Score **+1** for each successful catch.
- Lose one chance for every miss.
- Game over after **5 missed catches**.

## 🚀 How to Run the Game

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
3. Place `bg.gif` and `soundeffect.mp3` in the same folder as `main.py`.
4. Run `main.py` using Python IDLE or terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
